# Location_based_recommendations
This repository is about machine learning.
Recommendation systems are widely utilized in different applications for predicting the preference or rating of a user in a product or service. Most likely you have come across or interacted with some type of recommender systems in the past few minutes or hours in your online presence. These Recommender systems can be of different types and the most prominent ones include Content-based filtering and Collaborative filtering. In this article, we will study location-based recommendations, where we specifically focus on geographic locations to render more relevant recommendations utilizing the location of the users. To illustrate the crucial aspects of location-based recommenders we will perform a simple Location-based recommendation using the K-Means algorithm with Yelp Dataset from Kaggle.
